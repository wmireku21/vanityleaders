# What is Vanity Leaders?
Vanity Leaders is a rising entertainment organization that focuses on event planning and attracting audience to unknown talented music artists. Vanity offers a variety of services ranging from hosting events and casual fashion shows to going out on a nice day for beautiful photoshoot. The organization is currently looking to market themselves, increase their audience and hopefully turn into profitable business.



# Purpose
The purpose behind building the website was to give Vanity Leaders a way to showcase themselves and provide a way for customers to be updated on any Vanity news, know of any services they provide, get in contact with them, and more. In addition, Vanity Leaders realized, early-on, the importance of having a website to show potential new customers and investors what they have going on and how they plan to further themselves as a business.

# Technology
In order to build this website, I used the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to deal with the frontend and backend and deal with the API's in between. For the frontend, I integrated Boostrap to style the UI. I also used a SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to set up a system where users can directly email Vanity Leaders.
